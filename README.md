# Hey, I'm Tiago 👋

A software engineer shaped by some of China's most dynamic tech companies — now riding the AI wave into whatever comes next. 🚀

## 🏢 Where I've Been

🔋 **Anker Innovations** — Where hardware meets smart technology. Helped build products that ship to millions worldwide.

🛒 **Alibaba, Hangzhou** — Worked at the heart of China's e-commerce ecosystem, tackling challenges at massive scale.

💰 **JD Finance, Beijing** — Cut my teeth in fintech, building systems where reliability isn't optional.

Each stop taught me something different: speed, scale, precision. All of it made me a better engineer.

## 🤖 What I'm Up To Now

Deep-diving into AI and figuring out how it reshapes the way we build software. Not just using the tools — trying to understand where this is all heading and how to stay ahead of the curve.

## 🏍️ Beyond the Code

When I'm not at my desk, I'm probably on two wheels. Motorcycles keep me sharp — there's something about the focus it demands that carries over into everything else. I also spend a lot of time strength training 💪. Discipline in the gym, discipline in the code.

## ☕ Let's Connect

Always open to interesting conversations about AI, engineering, or where to find the best riding roads.
